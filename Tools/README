The main tool you want to develop implements the tool interface cause i believed that all tools at one point
interact with the canvas. You can add extra methods but make sure to include those methods in the interface as well.

The paint component handles the kind of work each tool is required to do. so the tool.current tool will determine
the part of the paint component to utilize. See PaintComponent for what i mean.
            Problem with this is how to keep the canvas from repainting each time a new tool is selected.

canvas is where the main work of the tool is done and the repaint method is called. Study pencil tool to see
Actionlistener is just a link between the icon, and the setting of the current tool to the tool selected. Once you
set the current tool to the tool clicked, make sure to deselect the other tools as well.
