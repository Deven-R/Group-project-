## Name
XYZ Graphics Editor

## Description

This project was made in regard to the 210 Module: Computer Science Group Project module at Lancaster University. The 'XYZ Editor' is a simple graphics editor giving users an application that allows them to import, edit and export their creative projects that have been edited using the XYZ editor. The application's target audience are individuals that are of ages 6 - 16.

Some of the notable features of the editor are:

- Drawing tools for freeform drawing onto a Canvas.
- Customizable color selection & brush size selection for drawing tools.
- Undo and redo functionality.
- Save and load image files.
- Invert Images.
- Zoom into the Canvas.
- Type text onto the Canvas.
- Fill the canvas with a desired colour.
- Multi-tab functionality, for hotswapping between Canvases.
- Intuitive User Interface allowing for a user to quickly get used to the editor and be able to work with more productivity.

Considerable amount of Accessibility features that include: 

- Tutorial feature: As soon as a user accesses the editor, they are greeted with a Tutorial prompt that allows them to get to know about the editor and it's tools.
- Fun Mascot that was integrated to the editor to appeal to the younger audience that may use the application.
- Language and Localization: The application includes langauge settings that can be changed to a user's preference. For the purpose of the module, three langauges that include: ENGLISH (Default), TURKISH  and CHINESE have been supported. 
- Themes: Themes that include LIGHT/DARK mode to reduce eye strain. For users that prefer more fun and classical themes, the Cappucino theme, Beautiful Blues and Austin Powers theme is made to suite all types of preferences.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
